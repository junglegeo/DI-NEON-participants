## NEON Puerto Rico

Hello all,

My name is **Mackenzie Vecchio** and I am a PhD student from Florida Atlantic University. I work with Dr. Xavier Comas on environmental geophysics research. I am currently working on new applications of ground penetrating radar (GPR) on tree trunks. Forest dynamics on grano diorite bedrock at El Yunque are constrained by geomorphology and the steep drop in elevation called the knickpoint. I am interested in measuring fracturing, regolith thickness, hydrology and moisture content of tree trunks using near surface geophysics.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
